# Cyber Kill Chain Steps

There are several actions that an attacker can take before, during, and after a successful cyber attack. These actions are sequential, and if the attacker fails at one stage, it is not possible to execute the next step of the cyber attack. The Cyber Kill Chain model divides these stages of attackers into 7 steps. The steps of cyber attacks are depicted in the visual  below:

* Reconnaissance
* Weaponization
* Delivery
* Exploitation
* Installation
* Command & Control (C2)
* Actions on Objectives
