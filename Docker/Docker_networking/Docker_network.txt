Docker Networking

When we install Docker, it creates three networks automatically. There are:

Bridge :- a bridge network uses a software bridge which lets containers connected to the same bridge network communicate, while providing isolation from containers that aren't connected to that bridge network.

#docker run ubuntu 

None :-  If you want to completely isolate the networking stack of a container, you can use the --network none flag when starting the container. Within the container, only the loopback device is created.

#docker run ubuntu --network=none

Host :-  this network automatically access the external port same as the internal port. Without using port mapping.

#docker run ubuntu --network=host

User-defined networks

To set a custom isolated network (when we using different range of internal ips) 
--------------------------------
#docker network create \
--driver bridge \
--subnet 182.18.0.0/16 
custom-isolated-network
---------------------------------

To list the docker networks

#docker network ls 

# docker inspect <container id or name>


Embedded DNS

To use container name instead of IPs.

Eg:- mysql.connect(mysql)

DNS server always using 127.0.0.1

DNS server creates namespace for each service.
