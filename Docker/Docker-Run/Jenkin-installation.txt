  Step to install and setup Jenkins


1. Install Jenkins (before we used a jenkins image which is now deprecated <docker run jenkins>. Instead of that, we have to use jenkins/jenkins.)

#docker run jenkins/jenkins

2. Check the port and internal ip address for testing using browser.

#docker ps (to find port)

#docker inspect <container_id>. (Check the network section)

Then try with browser

Next, try to access Jenkins using external IP address by mapping the port.

#docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins 

Later try with external IP address

3. Installing Jenkins with volume mapping to the local.

#docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /root/my-jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home -u root jenkins/jenkins

This will help to store the data in local directory and we can use the data when creating a new container.
